A few years ago I had a deep realization that my time and energy was limited but I still wanted to increase my output and impact on the world, so I decided to go digital and become a software developer. Since then Iâ€™ve grown a solid skill set of web development technologies such as HTML, CSS, Javascript, React, Node.js, Express, and Bootstrap by creating a portfolio of modern web applications.
